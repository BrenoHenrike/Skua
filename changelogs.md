# Skua 1.2.5.1
## Released: September 03, 2025

## What's Changed

## NET 9 WAS BAD FOR SKUA SO I REVERTED BACK TO NET 6 (also I actually didn't even change to net 9 for all projects that was my bad)
### Health Check
- anytime we pull from map ScriptMonsters we pulled from MapMonsters which didn't have the dataleaf connected to it
- added MapMonstersWithCurrentData which pulls the dataleaf from the monsters then merges it

### Fixed Keybinds
- I broke keybinds while fixing mem leaks (*still broken D:* )
- Keybinds should only work when focus into the game now

# Skua 1.2.5
## Released: September 02, 2025

## What's Changed

### 1. FlashUtil.cs - Flash Object Disposal Issues

**Problem**: The Flash object's event handlers were not unsubscribed before disposal, and the object reference wasn't cleared.

**Fix**:

- Unsubscribe `FlashCall` event before disposing Flash object in `InitializeFlash()`
- Properly clean up in `Dispose()` method
- Set Flash reference to null after disposal

### 2. ScriptInterface.cs - Thread and Event Handler Leaks

**Problem**:

- FlashCall event never unsubscribed
- ScriptInterfaceThread not properly terminated
- CancellationTokenSources not disposed
- Static instance reference not cleared

**Fix**:

- Implemented full IDisposable pattern
- Proper thread termination with timeout
- CancellationTokenSource cleanup
- Event handler unsubscription
- Static reference clearing

### 3. ListBoxScrollToCaretBehavior.cs - WPF Behavior Memory Leak

**Problem**: CollectionChanged event subscriptions weren't properly managed, causing collections to hold references to behaviors.

**Fix**:

- Store reference to collection source
- Properly unsubscribe using stored reference
- Clear ScrollViewer reference on unload

### 4. ScriptEvent.cs - Messenger Registration Leak

**Problem**: Registered with StrongReferenceMessenger but never unregistered, keeping object alive indefinitely.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Unregister all messenger subscriptions in Dispose()
- Clear all event handlers
- Added proper cleanup for all events

### 5. LogService.cs - TraceListener Memory Leak

**Problem**: TraceListener added to global Trace.Listeners but never removed, creating permanent reference.

**Fix**:

- Store reference to DebugListener
- Implemented IDisposable
- Remove listener from Trace.Listeners in Dispose()
- Clear log collections
- Unregister from messenger

### 6. CaptureProxy.cs - TcpClient Resource Leaks

**Problem**: TcpClient instances created in loop without proper disposal on exceptions.

**Fix**:

- Use local variables for proper scoping
- Ensure cleanup in catch blocks
- Add finally blocks for connection cleanup
- Properly handle cancellation

### 7. ScriptManager.cs - Thread Management Issues

**Problem**: Thread references overwritten without cleanup, no disposal pattern.

**Fix**: (hopefully didn't break anything)

- Thread cleanup should be added with proper join/wait
- IDisposable pattern should be implemented
- CancellationTokenSource proper disposal

### 8. SavedAdvancedSkillsViewModel.cs - ObservableCollection Recreation

**Problem**: Creates new ObservableCollection on every property access, causing memory churn and binding issues.

**Fix**:

- Cache ObservableCollection instance
- Only recreate when data actually changes
- Proper null checking and refresh logic

### 9. @!HotKeyService.cs - InputBindings Memory Leak

**Problem**: InputBindings added to MainWindow without proper cleanup, accumulating over time.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Track registered bindings in a list
- Clear bindings before adding new ones
- Proper cleanup in Dispose()

### 10. DialogService.cs - Event Handler Exception Safety

**Problem**: Event handler might not be removed if ShowDialog throws exception.

**Fix**:

- Added try-catch blocks around ShowDialog
- Ensure event handler removal in all cases
- Handler removal in catch block

### 11. AutoViewModel.cs - Task.Factory Without Cancellation

**Problem**: Tasks started without CancellationToken can't be properly cancelled.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Added CancellationTokenSource management
- Proper task cancellation and disposal
- Unregister from messenger in Dispose()

### 12. AdvancedSkillContainer.cs - Fire-and-Forget Tasks

**Problem**: Fire-and-forget tasks without error handling or cancellation.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Added CancellationTokenSource for save operations
- Track save tasks for proper cleanup
- Error handling in save operations

### 13. WindowService.cs - Managed Windows Dictionary

**Problem**: Windows added to dictionary but never removed when closed.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Add Closed event handler to remove from dictionary
- Clean up DataContext if IDisposable
- Dispose all managed windows on service disposal

### 14. PropertyGrid.xaml.cs - PropertyChanged Weak Event

**Problem**: PropertyChanged event subscription without weak references.

**Fix**:

- Use WeakEventManager for PropertyChanged subscriptions
- Try-catch for safe unsubscription
- Prevents strong references from keeping objects alive

# Skua 1.1.2
## Released: December 28, 2022

Quite some time I don't do this, the update fixes (I hope) some small but troublesome bugs:

- Hide to tray should not crash the app;
- "GitHub API limit reached" can still happen, but all you need to do is to authenticate one time and launch Skua using the launcher tab from the Manager, after that the auth token should be saved as it was supposed to;
- For some reason starting Auto Attack/Hunt froze the app, it will not happen anymore but it does take quite some time to start/stop, will keep that in mind for possible future updates;

That's not much I would say, there is some work done that I can't publish yet that lacks testing and proper implementation, with time they will come.

Also, @slypy been looking foward to help with Skua development, and before his interest in doing so, I never knew the pain in the ass it was to set up the source code to start working on it. So I uploaded the whole (even the WIP things I had going on) of it in the repo, hope that helps anyone that would like to contribute.

# Skua 1.1.1
## Released: September 08, 2022

Release to address some small problems:

- Enums that make use of "_"(underscore) to generate spaces in the UI should not crash the script compilation anymore;
- Fixed the size of script options. For some reason the cells where not taking the full width, making the fields too small to even see;
- Map Item ID grabber take into consideration swf files that might not have the ".swf" extension, this fix a conflict with how FFDec takes arguments;
- Options for _"Auto Update Scripts"_ and _"Check for Script Updates"_ back to the main client;
- `IScriptServer` Relogin methods now click the server instead of sending a command straight to connect to said server, this way the "Server" in the game options will show the right server name instead of the first server you logged in.

# Skua 1.0.2
## Released: August 25, 2022

Did an oopsie in the last release. While trying to reduce server spam, it made the return value notc so certain, so the change to `IScriptQuest.EnsureLoad` was reverted.

About the goals:

25/200$ - Follower/Synchronize Clients so you can use multiple accounts;
0/100$ - Manager so you can boot up multiple accounts with the click of a button;
25/100$ - Script making assistant, something between Scratch (programming language) and formulary filling;
?$ - Give me any idea, we can discuss about it and make it real.

# Skua 1.0
## Released: August 20, 2022

The birb is out.

Everything should work as intended, next release should be mainly documentation if no bug shows up.

There are some out of scope goals, they aren't planned for the normal development of Skua, but reaching them not only would help me keep motivated but also the community that I am sure would benefit from those tools.

25/200$ - Follower/Synchronize Clients so you can use multiple accounts;
0/100$ - Manager so you can boot up multiple accounts with the click of a button;
25/100$ - Script making assistant, something between Scratch (programming language) and formulary filling;
