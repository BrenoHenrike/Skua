# Skua 1.2.5
## Released: September 02, 2025

## What's Changed

### 1. FlashUtil.cs - Flash Object Disposal Issues

**Problem**: The Flash object's event handlers were not unsubscribed before disposal, and the object reference wasn't cleared.

**Fix**:

- Unsubscribe `FlashCall` event before disposing Flash object in `InitializeFlash()`
- Properly clean up in `Dispose()` method
- Set Flash reference to null after disposal

### 2. ScriptInterface.cs - Thread and Event Handler Leaks

**Problem**:

- FlashCall event never unsubscribed
- ScriptInterfaceThread not properly terminated
- CancellationTokenSources not disposed
- Static instance reference not cleared

**Fix**:

- Implemented full IDisposable pattern
- Proper thread termination with timeout
- CancellationTokenSource cleanup
- Event handler unsubscription
- Static reference clearing

### 3. ListBoxScrollToCaretBehavior.cs - WPF Behavior Memory Leak

**Problem**: CollectionChanged event subscriptions weren't properly managed, causing collections to hold references to behaviors.

**Fix**:

- Store reference to collection source
- Properly unsubscribe using stored reference
- Clear ScrollViewer reference on unload

### 4. ScriptEvent.cs - Messenger Registration Leak

**Problem**: Registered with StrongReferenceMessenger but never unregistered, keeping object alive indefinitely.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Unregister all messenger subscriptions in Dispose()
- Clear all event handlers
- Added proper cleanup for all events

### 5. LogService.cs - TraceListener Memory Leak

**Problem**: TraceListener added to global Trace.Listeners but never removed, creating permanent reference.

**Fix**:

- Store reference to DebugListener
- Implemented IDisposable
- Remove listener from Trace.Listeners in Dispose()
- Clear log collections
- Unregister from messenger

### 6. CaptureProxy.cs - TcpClient Resource Leaks

**Problem**: TcpClient instances created in loop without proper disposal on exceptions.

**Fix**:

- Use local variables for proper scoping
- Ensure cleanup in catch blocks
- Add finally blocks for connection cleanup
- Properly handle cancellation

### 7. ScriptManager.cs - Thread Management Issues

**Problem**: Thread references overwritten without cleanup, no disposal pattern.

**Fix**: (hopefully didn't break anything)

- Thread cleanup should be added with proper join/wait
- IDisposable pattern should be implemented
- CancellationTokenSource proper disposal

### 8. SavedAdvancedSkillsViewModel.cs - ObservableCollection Recreation

**Problem**: Creates new ObservableCollection on every property access, causing memory churn and binding issues.

**Fix**:

- Cache ObservableCollection instance
- Only recreate when data actually changes
- Proper null checking and refresh logic

### 9. @!HotKeyService.cs - InputBindings Memory Leak

**Problem**: InputBindings added to MainWindow without proper cleanup, accumulating over time.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Track registered bindings in a list
- Clear bindings before adding new ones
- Proper cleanup in Dispose()

### 10. DialogService.cs - Event Handler Exception Safety

**Problem**: Event handler might not be removed if ShowDialog throws exception.

**Fix**:

- Added try-catch blocks around ShowDialog
- Ensure event handler removal in all cases
- Handler removal in catch block

### 11. AutoViewModel.cs - Task.Factory Without Cancellation

**Problem**: Tasks started without CancellationToken can't be properly cancelled.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Added CancellationTokenSource management
- Proper task cancellation and disposal
- Unregister from messenger in Dispose()

### 12. AdvancedSkillContainer.cs - Fire-and-Forget Tasks

**Problem**: Fire-and-forget tasks without error handling or cancellation.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Added CancellationTokenSource for save operations
- Track save tasks for proper cleanup
- Error handling in save operations

### 13. WindowService.cs - Managed Windows Dictionary

**Problem**: Windows added to dictionary but never removed when closed.

**Fix**:

- Implemented IDisposable
- Add Closed event handler to remove from dictionary
- Clean up DataContext if IDisposable
- Dispose all managed windows on service disposal

### 14. PropertyGrid.xaml.cs - PropertyChanged Weak Event

**Problem**: PropertyChanged event subscription without weak references.

**Fix**:

- Use WeakEventManager for PropertyChanged subscriptions
- Try-catch for safe unsubscription
- Prevents strong references from keeping objects alive
